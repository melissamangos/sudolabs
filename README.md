# Sudo Website Repo

<h2>How to Work with the Repo</h2>
Make sure node.js is installed on your computer so you can use <code>npm install</code>
<br>
Run <code>npm install</code> in your sudolabs folder and <code>package.json</code> should install all necessary libraries.
<br><br>
<strong>If <code>npm install</code> does not work, follow the following steps:</strong>
<br>
&nbsp; 1. Install gulp with the following command: <code>npm install --global gulp-cli</code>
<br>
&nbsp; 2. Install gulp-sass with the following command: <code>npm install gulp-sass</code>
<br>
&nbsp; 3. Install gulp-livereload with the following command: <code>npm install gulp-livereload</code>
<br>
&nbsp; 4. Install the Live Reload Chrome Extension
<br>
&nbsp; 5. Check if it installed correctly by entering <code>gulp -v</code> into the command line and having the version number return.
